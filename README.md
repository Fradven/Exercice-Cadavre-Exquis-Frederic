#Old Greg
***
In the early hours of dusk, Old Greg from his boat looks at the morning myst fading from the surface of the lake.
A tear fall from his eye as he thinks of his friend Haward and the Beileys they could have been drinking if he hadn't left. No more "love game" for them.

Old Greg gets out of his cabin and goes out on the main deck, grieved. All the memories they had together came rushing back to him as he felt really alone and didn't have anything to do. Or at least that's what he said.
