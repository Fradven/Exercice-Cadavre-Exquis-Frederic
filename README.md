#Old Greg
***
In the early hours of dusk, Old Greg from his boat looks at the morning myst fading from the surface of the lake.
A tear fall from his eye as he thinks of his friend Haward and the Beileys they could have been drinking if he hadn't left. No more "love game" for them.
***
Haward had been his best friend ever since he could remember. They met as children in the summer of 54. Haward looked like a barrel back then. A young portly lad with a big nose and discheveled hair.
***
He might be fat but he had incredible humor and a big heart for alcohol. It was his cute sin he liked to drink
***
Suddenly, he sees a big storm coming, ...

***
Leaves start flying, trees start shaking, you can hear the thunder. The sound of the rain can be heard in the distance. It's pouring in the horizon and you can see the rain getting closer.
